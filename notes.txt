# 1 What is Git?
Distributed Version Control System

# 2
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

#3 Git Objects
A git repository is actually just a collection of objects, each identified with their own hash.
When you add a file, you get a hash generated on its contents, and this hash is used to uniquely
point to that version of a file.

#4 Starting a Repository
  $ mkdir store
  $ cd store
  $ git init (initialize empty git repository)

#5 commit
  $ git status
  $ git add
  $ git commit

#6 What is a branch?
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.
Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.
master: default branch
  $ git checkout

# 7 log
Show te commit logs
  $ git log

# 8 Cloning
Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned
repository, and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active branch.

# 9 Remote Branches

# 10 Tagging
Is a reference to a commit

# 11 Rebase
  $ git Rebase
Moves all changes to master
Run all origin/master commits
Run all commits in the temporary area, one at the time.

# 12 Local Branch Rebase

# 13 History

# 14 Interactive Rebase
pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, exec

# 15 Stash
When you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working
directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.

# 16 Purging history

# 17 Working Together

# 18 Cherry Pick
When we need a commit from the development branch in the production branch

# 19 Submododules

# 20 Reflog
Reference logs, record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.
Reflogs are useful in various Git commands, to specify the old value of a reference. For example, HEAD@{2}
